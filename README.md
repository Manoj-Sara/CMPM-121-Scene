# Scene Description
My scene is a creepy bathroom on an alien planet. I included objects like a bloody bathtub, a dirty toilet, a large bloody knife in the corner, and more objects that would lend to the horror vibe. Recently, I got really sick and felt nauseous, so I went to the bathroom to throw up. I wound end up not being able to for a very long time, and sitting next to the toilet for 30 minutes made me think about the bathroom and all its dirtiness a lot. This inspired me to make my scene. The main character of the scene is a skeleton that would jumpscare any person that walked through the door and turned around after seeing what's inside.
